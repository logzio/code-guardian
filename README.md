# Code Guardian
Code Guardian is a project designed to prevent sensitive data from becoming public. Thus, making an attacker's life harder.

It consists of two different plugins: [Pre-Commit Guaridan](https://github.com/logzio/code-guardian/tree/master/git-guardian) and [Docker Build Guardian](https://github.com/logzio/code-guardian/tree/master/docker-guardian).

### Requirements

 - Both plugins require Python to be installed on your machine.
 - The Docker Build Guardian will only work if you use ZSH.
